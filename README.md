# 4. Briefly identify the difference between PCA and LDA
Both LDA and PCA rely on linear transformations and aim to maximize the variance in a lower dimension. PCA is an unsupervised learning algorithm while LDA is a supervised learning algorithm. This means that PCA finds directions of maximum variance regardless of class labels while LDA finds directions of maximum class separability.
